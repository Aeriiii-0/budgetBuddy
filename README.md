Budget Buddy

A system that literally lives up to its name (to be a friend when it comes to expenses).

This is a system made for the students and working beings to keep track of every cent they spend on a daily basis.
It allows users to input their weekly allowance and will suggest weekly allocation in order to save and spend their money accordingly.
It also provides feedback on user's daily expenses. Whether they exceed, saved, or just spent the right amount allocated for the day
and a cherry on top, it releases weekly financial report to look back on the total amount they spent throughout the whole week.

Areas to develop in the future:
+ Monthly and annual financial report, including statistical assessments.
+ Enable "Goal Setting" mode, set specified amount to attain within selected timeframe.
+ Add Loan, Bills, Investment, and Insurance tracker.
+ Integrate with banks and online finance application to pay bills with ease.
